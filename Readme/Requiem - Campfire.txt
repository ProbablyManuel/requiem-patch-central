Updated to Requiem 4.0.0.


3.15

The enchantments of amulets attached to backpacks have the same magnitude as the standalone amulet, but they only become active if you are currently under the blessing of that divine.

Attaching amulets to backpacks and separating them can be done by the Create Item power.

Price of backpacks is increased to take any attached amulet into account.

Most basic items can be created without the Craftsmanship perk.


3.07

Separating "Backpack, Black Fur (Kynareth)" no longer creates an "Separate: Backpack, Black Fur - Amulet of Kynareth" item in your inventory that generates an infinite number of backpacks. This fix doesn't work on already spawned items.
