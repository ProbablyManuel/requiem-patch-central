Info:

This patch is meant to be used alongside Craftable Horse Barding.

Do NOT install the Hearthfire patch from Immersive Horses. It's fully included in this patch.

The "open inventory" option from Immersive Horses acts just like the "search" option from Requiem (when used on a horse). Use whatever method you prefer.



Load Order:

Must be loaded after "Requiem - SkyTEST.esp".

Must be loaded after "Requiem - Wild World.esp".

Must be loaded after "Requiem - Minor Arcana - Roleplaying.esp".
