Black Mage Robes			Craftmanship					no armor rating
Black Mage Armor (light armor)		Advanced Light Armors				similiar stats to scaled armor
Black Mage Plate Armor			Advanced Blacksmithing				similiar stats to steel plate armor
Black Arch-Mage's Robes			Being Arch-Mage, Craftmanship			no armor rating
Black Arch-Mage's Armor (light armor)	Being Arch-Mage, Advanced Light Armors		similar stats to glass armor
Black Arch-Mage's Plate Armor		Being Arch-Mage, Advanced Blacksmithing		smiliar stats to ebony armor

The crafting system around the Black Mage Focusing Gem has been removed.

Black Arch-Mage's chest and feet pieces can be "enchanted" with the standard Arch-Mage robes enchanment.
Found at the forge, requires the standard Arch-Mage's robes or boots and the correspondening Black Arch-Mage's piece.
