Info:

Do NOT install the Better Eagle Eye and Faster Arrows tweak. They don't work with Requiem.

The Stealth Meter Tweak conflicts with Requiem's option that hides the Activate button.
If you intend to make extensive edits to the UI, you should consider using a dedicated UI mod such as Less Intrusive HUD II.

Scoped Bows have the same stats as their Requiem counterpart +0.5 weight.
