Info:

Glaives and (short)spears are new weapon types without proper integration to Skyrim and tridents are an exotic weapon type that's not suitable for combat.
For the sake of simplicity they share their stats with the (great)sword of the same level. They deal piercing damage.
NPCs won't use them because they lack proper animations.

The stats of the new weapons types are as follows. All numbers are prior to running the Reqtificator.

Club (Mace):
-1 damage, -1 weight, +0.05 speed, -0.15 stagger

Dai-Katana (Greatsword):
-1 damage, +0.075 speed

Halberd (Battleaxe):
