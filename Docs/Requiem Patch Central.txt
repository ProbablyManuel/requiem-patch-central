Bashed Patch

The official Requiem advice regarding a [Bashed Patch](https://github.com/ProbablyManuel/requiem/wiki/Bashed-Patch) applies to the Requiem Patch Central too.

The Import feature of a Bashed Patch is not supported for any types except those explicitly listed as safe in the above advice. The manner in which a Bashed Patch imports records is too limited to handle non-trivial interactions between multiple pugins even when the plugins have proper bash tags assigned.
