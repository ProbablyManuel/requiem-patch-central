Info:

All armors and weapons are distributed to unique NPCs with the aim of visual storystelling. They are neither craftable nor found in random loot.

The table below uses the original names, but most items are renamed to match the new implementation. The last column indicates whether the armor overlaps with the official Requiem - Creation Club patch which means load order will determine which armor appears in the game.
