Info:

The patch currently doesn't edit the new creatures added by the mod.
Since the new creatures are unique and I haven't used Lucien myself, I don't really know what to do with them.
They're only present in a new dungeon added by the mod and shouldn't be a major problem (if it's a problem at all).
